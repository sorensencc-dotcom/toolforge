# Historical Revocation Verification

When verifying historical signatures:
- A signature generated *before* the key's revocation timestamp remains cryptographically valid under the **Sigil Trust Engine**.
- Local connectors must cache revoked keys with their active revocation intervals inside the **Local SQLite database** to check transaction histories offline.
