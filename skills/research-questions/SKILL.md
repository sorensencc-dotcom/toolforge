# Research Questions

## Input

A topic name, e.g. `willow-run`. Locate the topic's ingest directory:
`C:\Users\soren\trm-vault\topics\charlie\<topic>\trm-ingest\`.
Requires `curator-decisions-final.json` to already exist there (output of
curator-decision-processor.mjs).

## Steps

1. **Generate draft questions.** Run:
   `node C:\dev\src\harvester\external\scan-gaps.mjs --decisions=<path to curator-decisions-final.json> --topic=<topic>`
   This writes `draft-questions.json` into the same directory.

2. **Load existing state.** If `research-questions.json` already exists in
   that directory, read it. Any question whose `id` + `question_origin_hash`
   matches an existing `closed` entry is already resolved — carry it
   forward unchanged, do not re-search it. Any question with a new or
   changed `question_origin_hash` (or not present before) needs processing
   as below. This is what makes reruns incremental instead of re-asking
   settled questions.

3. **For each `open` question needing processing:**
   - **Vision-read first, for `low-confidence` and `gap` questions.** Look
     for a local photo file matching the question's `fact_id` under
     `<topic>/analyzed/variants/` (glob `<fact_id-stripped-of-any-.jpg-suffix>*`
     — variants carry letter suffixes like `_a`, `_c`, `76226_c.jpg`). If a
     match exists, `Read` the image file directly and judge from the actual
     pixels before touching WebSearch:
     - **Content check:** does what's visible in the photo match the
       question's topic label (e.g. factory-floor production vs. an
       airport/tarmac scene vs. a ceremonial/bond-drive setting)? A clear
       mismatch or match is a strong, directly-observed signal — weight it
       above a web search would ever get you, since these are unpublished
       archive originals with no other corroborating source.
     - **ID-integrity check:** many prints carry a negative number stamped
       directly in-frame (bottom-right corner is typical for this archive).
       If a legible stamped number is visible and it does **not** match the
       question's `fact_id`, this is a metadata bug, not a content
       question — set `id_mismatch_flagged: true` and record the stamped
       number you actually read in `id_mismatch_observed`. Cross-check
       against any other variant file for that stamped number (e.g. if
       `76226_c.jpg` reads `76266-C` in-frame, check whether a
       `76266_*.jpg` file exists and depicts the same shoot) — if so, note
       that correspondence in the `answer` field so a human can reconcile
       the two fact_ids.
     - If the vision read gives a clear verdict (content matches/doesn't
       match, and no unresolved ID mismatch): set `status: 'closed'`,
       `answer`, `confidence: 'high'`, `sources: ['local-archive-visual-read']`.
     - If an ID mismatch is flagged and can't be resolved by you alone
       (i.e. it needs a curator decision, not just a note): set
       `status: 'escalated'`, `escalation_reason` describing the mismatch,
       keep `id_mismatch_flagged`/`id_mismatch_observed` set regardless of
       status.
     - If no local photo file matches the `fact_id` at all, fall through to
       the WebSearch step below — there's nothing to look at.
   - **WebSearch fallback**, for `curator-flagged` questions and any
     `low-confidence`/`gap` question with no matching local photo file: run
     WebSearch using the question text (and `fact_id`/topic as context) as
     the query. Record the exact query string(s) tried in
     `search_terms_used`.
   - Increment `search_attempt_count` (starts at 0, so first attempt = 1)
     whenever WebSearch is actually invoked; a vision-only resolution does
     not increment this counter.
   - Judge the search results yourself:
     - If results clearly and specifically answer the question with a
       source you'd trust: set `status: 'closed'`, `answer` (your
       synthesized answer), `confidence: 'high'`, `sources` (the URLs that
       support it).
     - If results are thin, contradictory, or off-topic: set
       `status: 'escalated'`, `escalation_reason` (why — e.g. "no sources
       mention this photo directly" or "two sources disagree on date"),
       keep any partial `answer` you can offer with `confidence: 'low'`.
     - If the search errored or returned nothing at all: leave
       `status: 'open'`, just update `search_attempt_count`,
       `search_terms_used`, and `last_attempt`. Do not force a
       closed/escalated verdict on a failed search — that's a rule from
       the design spec, not a judgment call.
   - If a search result (or a vision read) surfaces a new unknown not
     covered by any existing question (e.g. a name or date mentioned that
     raises its own question, or a cross-referenced fact_id from an ID
     mismatch), append it to that question's `new_leads` array as a plain
     string. Do not silently drop it, and do not create a new top-level
     question entry for it in this pass — `new_leads` is picked up as
     input the next time `scan-gaps.mjs`-equivalent triage happens on this
     topic (future enhancement; for now it's just recorded).
   - Set `last_attempt` to the current ISO timestamp regardless of outcome.

4. **Write `research-questions.json`** in the topic's `trm-ingest/`
   directory: the full question list (open, closed, and escalated),
   matching the augmented shape from the design spec. Carry `deterministic_id`
   and `created_at` forward unchanged from `draft-questions.json` — they're
   set once at generation time, not per-run. Also include a top-level `llm`
   provenance block recording what produced this run's verdicts:
   `{ "model": "claude-sonnet-5", "run_at": "<ISO timestamp>" }` — this is
   an audit trail (which model made the close/escalate calls), not a cache
   key; overwrite it each run.

5. **Recompute focus areas.** Run:
   `node C:\dev\src\harvester\external\update-focus-areas.mjs --questions=<path to research-questions.json>`
   This writes `focus-areas.json` into the same directory.

6. **Report to the user:** how many questions were closed / escalated /
   still open, and the resulting focus areas ranked by priority.

## Error handling

- If `curator-decisions-final.json` is missing, tell the user and stop —
  do not fabricate a batch.
- If `scan-gaps.mjs` or `update-focus-areas.mjs` exit non-zero, surface
  the exact stderr to the user and stop; do not attempt to hand-write the
  JSON yourself as a substitute for a script failure.
- Per-topic failures in a scheduled sweep (multiple topics processed in
  one invocation) must not stop the remaining topics — log which topic
  failed and continue to the next.
