## Source Citations

**Primary Source:** `path/to/file.sh` lines 10–45  
**Secondary Source:** `path/to/related-file.md` lines 5–20  
**Pack Reference:** `--- START FILE: path/to/file.sh ---` to `--- END FILE: path/to/file.sh ---`

[If multiple sources, list them all with line ranges if known. If this is a conceptual entity (not directly in source), write "N/A — derived from multiple sources" and list them.]

## Implementation Notes

[Non-obvious architectural decisions, gotchas, design rationale, or behavioral nuances that aren't clear from code alone. Examples:
- "Fails gracefully if X is missing (doesn't crash the pipeline)"
- "Uses mapfile instead of while-read to avoid subshell issues"
- "Path normalization handles both Windows backslashes and Unix forward slashes"
- "Obsidian uses manifest mode; NotebookLM uses default mode"

If no special notes, write "None."]
