# Sigil Consult

Send a question or design to another agent (Codex) over the local Sigil relay and wait for its reply, without manual "check your inbox" relaying. This codifies the pattern proven live on 2026-08-15/16: send, background `inbox --wait`, report when it fires.

## Preconditions

- Canonical checkout is `C:\dev\sigil-repo` — always run Sigil commands from there. A second checkout (`C:\dev\sigil`) exists with its own separate `.sigil/` identities; using it silently talks to the wrong registry (root cause of a real incident this session).
- A relay must already be up on `http://127.0.0.1:8791` / stream `ws://127.0.0.1:8793/v1/stream`. Check with:
  ```powershell
  netstat -ano | findstr "8791 8793"
  ```
  If nothing is listening, start one (identities must already exist in `.sigil/registry.json` — never re-run `sigil init` for an identity that already has a file, it silently rotates tokens and the relay's in-memory snapshot goes stale):
  ```powershell
  cd C:\dev\sigil-repo
  node sigil/cli/sigil.mjs relay up --port 8791 --stream-port 8793
  ```

## Process

1. **Compose the message.** Summarize the question/context/design tersely — the recipient has no memory of this conversation. Include enough for them to act without asking follow-ups, but don't paste the whole transcript.
2. **Send it:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\dev\sigil-repo
   node sigil/cli/sigil.mjs send --identity .sigil/claude.identity.json --relay-url http://127.0.0.1:8791 --to ep_codex --to-owner usr_soren --conversation <conv_id> --message "<message>"
   ```
   Reuse an existing `--conversation` id if this is a continuation of an earlier exchange; otherwise omit it (auto-generates one) and remember it for follow-ups.
3. **Arm the wait, backgrounded:**
   ```powershell
   node sigil/cli/sigil.mjs inbox --wait --identity .sigil/claude.identity.json --relay-url http://127.0.0.1:8791 --stream-url ws://127.0.0.1:8793/v1/stream
   ```
   Run this as a background task. It exits on its own the moment a reply arrives (or on timeout/error — see exit codes below) — the background-task-completion notification is what surfaces the reply into this session. Do not poll it manually while it's running; that defeats the point.
4. **Tell the user Codex needs to check its own inbox** (this skill doesn't control Codex's session) — unless Codex already has its own `--wait` armed from a prior turn in this same collaboration.
5. **When the wait exits, read its output.** Exit code 0 means a message arrived — read the printed line, act on it, report to the user. Non-zero:
   - `2` timeout (default 300s) — re-arm if still waiting, or tell the user nothing came back
   - `3` auth, `4` connection — relay/registry problem, diagnose before retrying (see stale-relay-snapshot note above)
   - `5` malformed — the delivered item didn't parse as expected; do not treat as a normal reply
   - `130`/`143` — the wait was interrupted; nothing was acknowledged, safe to re-arm

## What this is not

Not a persistent inbox integration — each consult is a manual send + one background wait, scoped to this skill invocation. See `docs/meta/sigil-host-inbox-wait-convention.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-sigil-inbox-wait-design.md` in `sigil-repo` for the underlying mechanism and its adapter-convention caveat (background-task-completion-on-exit is host behavior, not a Sigil protocol guarantee).
